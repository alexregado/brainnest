<body>
    <ol>
        <li>What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS? </li>
        <!-- <p>The main diference is related to specificity of the rules (inline is the most specific but less practical) and loading time (external CSS will need to download the file first and then render the styles).</p> -->
        <li>What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?</li>
        <p>.class and #id</p>
        <li>How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?</li>
        <p>.selectorOne, .selectorTwo {</p>
        <li>Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?</li>
        <p>#title.primary {</p>
        <li>What does the descendant combinator do?</li>
        <p>The descendant combinator allows the developer to change the style of a child element if is present in the parent element.</p>
        <li>Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity? </li>
        <p>The class selector rule because is more specific</p>
        <li>From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties? </li>
    </ol>
